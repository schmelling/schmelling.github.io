title: About

I’m a graduate student in the lab for [Synthetic Microbiology](http://www.synmikrobiologie.hhu.de/en.html) at 
HHU Duesseldorf. We study regulatory processes of small RNAs and global regulation 
of the circadian clock and DNA supercoiling in cyanobacteria. In my work I use 
computational approaches to gain new insights about the circadian clock in cyanobacteria. 
Besides the work in the lab I enjoy teaching [Data Analysis in Python](https://github.com/schmelling/V504). 
I use Python as my programming language of choice in both research and teaching.
The idea of open science and reproducibility was brought to my attention by [Titus Brown](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog), 
which was a game changer in the early stages of my career as a researcher. 
Since then I try to share my work as openly as possible on my [github page](https://github.com/schmelling). 
Further I will use this blog as another platform to communicate my ideas and thought and 
try to publish my work as preprints and in open access journals.
Outside of work I like to learn more about data science and machine learning. 
I’m a sport enthusiast, who actively exercises various sports but also enjoys watching all sorts of sports, 
from winter sports such as biathlon to soccer and american football.
