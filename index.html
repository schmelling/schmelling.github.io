        <p>Hi there, I am Nic, a <span>computational biologist</span> and <span>data scientist</span> in the making.<br>
           When I&rsquo;m not wrangling data sets, I&rsquo;m passionate about <span>open science,
           data visualization, teaching, scientific communication, &amp; web design</span>.</p>

          <h2>&ldquo;I could have downloaded the ugly word doc from the server or simply use protocols.io&rdquo;</h2>
          <p>A question that always comes up when talking about protocols.io adresses the problem of repeating a method from a
             published paper for your own research. I think every researcher in the life sciences already had this problem.
             You catch yourself reading a paper and thinking &ldquo;Wow, this method could be really helpful to solve my problem XY&rdquo;,
             then you&rsquo;re browsing through the method section, reading what is often just two sentences about the method you&rsquo;re
             interested in, and than think &ldquo;How on earth should I make sense out of it and actually reproduce this experiment?&rdquo;.
             It is not the researcher who is to blame for that, because often enough you have a space limit for your publication
             and you rather cut the method section than your precious results or discussion. This, however, puts a huge burden
             on the <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970" target="_blank">reproducibility</a>
             of the study and the credibility of the whole community. That&rsquo;s one of the
             <a href="https://www.protocols.io/groups/verve-net/discussions/why-do-protocols-matter" target="_blank">reason</a>
             why many studies can&rsquo;t be reproduced.<br>
             I&rsquo;m currently part of <a href="https://www.wikimedia.de/wiki/Fellowprogramm" target="_blank">Wikimedia&rsquo;s Open Science fellow program</a>,
             part of which it is to raise awareness for open science practices in the lab, department, or community. So I was looking
             for a solution to the previously described problem and also a solution for our lab to organize our protocols in a
             centralized repository. That&rsquo;s when I came across
             <a href="https://www.protocols.io/" target="_blank">protocols.io</a>, a platform, which addresses this issue of giving the description
             of methods its deserved space. After some initial testing on my own, I thought it would be best to organize a
             hackathon where we come together and digitize our lab protocols and put protocols.io through its paces.<br>
             A hackathon or even a couple of hours is the perfect setting for such an endeavor, because it is really hard to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>motivate people to write down their methods in a reproducible way and</li>
            <li>to get people to interrupt their &ldquo;important&rdquo; research for such a trivial thing.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you&rsquo;re a grad student like myself, it is really helpful to get your PI to support this or maybe even
             let her require an attendance.<br>
             So, I organized a <a href="https://github.com/schmelling/protocol_hackathon" target="_blank">two day hackathon</a>
             the week before Christmas and almost everyone showed up (even though it was not mandatory ;-). We started by
             first writing a Word document, if it wasn&rsquo;t already available and then copy/paste it into the text boxes
             on protocols.io. This worked worse than I thought it would and cost us a lot of time. I recommend to
             directly use the interface on protocols.io and export a PDF in the end or copy/paste it into a Word document,
             if that is was you prefer. The reason why copy/paste didn&rsquo;t worked so well is just that you sometimes
             need to create a second protocol for the preparation of a single step. For example, you want to purify
             proteins and later separate them on a gel. The preparation of the gel is a little bit more complex,
             so you create a second protocol for this. In your Word file it would, however, just be a couple of side steps.<br>
             Overall, I think the hackathon was a great success, <a href="https://www.protocols.io/groups/axmann-lab" target="_blank">we</a>
             created roughly 30 protocols, 10 of which are already openly available on protocols.io under CC-BY license.
             I think not the amount of protocols is important here, it was more that people actually recognized how
             important the creation of methods are and how much time it takes to do it. In the end we all agreed that
             it is worth doing and appreciated the presence of a platform like protocols.io. One thing that amazed me
             the most, was that people in the lab started using protocols.io's ability to interactively run protocols
             in the web browser or on your smartphone.
