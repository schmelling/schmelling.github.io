title: Advanced Ctrl-F
---

Ever wanted to search for a word in a text and wanted to include some variances or
variability? Regular Expressions or advanced Ctrl-F, as I like to call it, is the answer.

Around two weeks ago the [DIB lab](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/) hosted another of their great [training](http://dib-training.readthedocs.org/en/pub/) sessions. 
These training sessions are usually broadcasted via Google Hangout and are also later 
available on-demand on Youtube. This is such an awesome feature as some people, including 
me, have sometimes problems to follow at the same time due to different time zones. 

This [half-day workshop](http://dib-training.readthedocs.org/en/pub/2016-02-17-regular-expressions-python.html), lead by [Tiffany Timbers](https://twitter.com/tiffanytimbers), was about regular expressions 
and how to use it in Python.

I have to admit I never knowingly used regular expressions before and I feel like I 
missed out on a powerful tool. But now that I know, I’m BLOWN AWAY. 

First of all, Tiffany did a great job as an instructor. In the beginning of the workshop
regular expression were used to filter correct phone numbers and e-mail addresses. 
For this task the online tool [regexr](http://regexr.com) was used. Afterwards the 
exercises and topics switched to something more biological, where we were asked to 
identify CRISPR sites and transcription factor binding sites.

After half way through the workshop I wanted to try out what I learned so far 
for some on going research. A colleague in the lab is currently investigating a conserved 
motive in the promoter region of genes that showed up in microarray experiments. I asked 
if I could try out regular expressions to look for this motive in the whole genome of 
Synechocystis. At the beginning I struggled a little with the details, but after a while I 
got the hang of it. The results of my first search look actually quite good and I’m 
really excited to investigate the potential targets in more depths.

Some concluding remarks:

1. Regular expression are awesome.

2. DIB training session and their on-demand workshop are even better. 

I can highly recommend watching or better attending these workshops. The next workshop on 
my list, even though it is long overdue, is about scipy.optimize. Let’s see if it is as 
inspiring as regular expressions.
