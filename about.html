    	<h1>About</h1>
    	<p>Im a graduate student in the lab for Synthetic Microbiology at HHU Duesseldorf. We study regulatory 
    	processes of small RNAs and global regulation of the circadian clock and DNA supercoiling in cyanobacteria.
    	In my work I use computational approaches to gain new insights about the circadian clock in cyanobacteria.
    	Besides the work in the lab I enjoy teaching Data Analysis in Python. I use Python as my programming language
    	of choice in both research and teaching.
    	
    	The idea of open science and reproducibility was brought to my attention by Titus Brown, which was a game
    	changer in the early stages of my career as a researcher. Since then I try to share my work as openly as
    	possible on my github page. Further I will use this blog as another platform to communicate my ideas and
    	thought and try to publish my work as preprints and in open access journals.
    	
    	Outside of work I like to learn more about data science and machine learning. Im a sport enthusiast, 
    	who actively exercises various sports but also enjoys watching all sorts of sports, from winter sports
    	such as biathlon to soccer and american football.</p>
